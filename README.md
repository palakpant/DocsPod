# DocsPod


Project Idea: The main idea for this project was to build something that conveys my idea as a reality. The idea was to build something that connects doctors and patients from all over the World, so that doctors from all over the World can come together on a same platform and help the patients everywhere in a quick easy way.

The simple design of the webpage makes it easier for a person to navigate through the website and use it in a hassle free way. The tech stack used here is HTML and CSS along with some Bootstrap. 

DocsPod is a Doctor's Pod. Like you get peas in a pod, similarly in this Pod, you get to have three major categories for a patient's diagnosis--Mental Health, Physical Health and most importantly for Children's Health.

A carousel has been made using Bootstrap to authenticate the usage of the site. The testimonials from a variety of individiuals and also from huge news portals add as an advantage to promote the page and also contribute to the authenticity.

It also has a pricing panel demonstrating the cost of each category that the user wants to avail.

Note: This is a purely hypothetical page as of now, but I am still working to bring it to scale as soon as possible. 
DocsPod is an acronym for my mini project Doctor's Pod.
